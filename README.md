# RL Algorithms from scratch
This repository contains PyTorch implementations of some of the mainly used Reinforcement Learning algorithms from scratch. The project focuses at implementing the algorithms in a clean and readable way.

Still under development. Currently available algorithms:
* Vanilla Policy Gradient (PG)
* Policy Gradient with value baseline
* Deep Q Network (DQN)
* Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
* Soft Actor Critic (SAC)
